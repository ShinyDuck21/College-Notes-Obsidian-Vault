*Chislom v. Georgia* (1793)
 - First major case, citizen of one state suing another state
 - Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in this
 - Gave federal government jurisdiction in state issues
 - Ruled *[[Article III#Section II|Art III, sec 2]]* gave federal courts jurisdiction in such cases

Congress immediately responded with proposing 11th amendment in 1794
 - Ratified by the states in 1795

11th Amendment removed that jurisdiction in cases which states are parties - state power

Massive blow to the judiciary
 - 1st case supreme court handles and we decide founding fathers were wrong

## Judicial Review - *Marbury v. Madison* (1803)
---
Case rose from battle between Federalist Party (Adams) and Democratic-Republican Party (Jefferson), 1800 Election
 - Justices of Peace (judges), writ of mandamus, original jurisdiction 
 - Congress unconstitutionally expanded Court's original jurisdiction in [[Article III#Judiciary Act of 1789|Judiciary Act of 1789]]

Marshall (Federalist) had been looking to expand federal power, particularly that of the judiciary
 - This case provided the vehicle to do so

Established the concept of [[Article III#Judicial review|Judicial Review]], more that 'made up' for the blow in *Chisholm* and the 11th Amendment
