1796 election had Adams (federalist) win presidency but Jefferson (Democratic-Republican) win vice presidency
 - This was a problem
 - Why?
	 - President pulling one way but vice-president pulling other way
	 - response was 12th Amendment, splitting Electoral College votes into president and vice president
