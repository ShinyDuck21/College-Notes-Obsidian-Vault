 - Because we can
 - Ties back to [[The Declaration of Independence and Locke#Property|Locke and Property]]

 - [[Article I#Section II|Art. I, Sec. 2]]: "Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States"
 - [[Article I#Section IX|Art. 1, sec. 9]]: "No capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken."

	 - This amendment disconnected that
	 - Progressive income tax came from this
	 - Majority taxing the Minority
