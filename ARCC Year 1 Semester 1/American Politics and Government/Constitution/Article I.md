 - [[The Declaration of Independence and Locke#State of Nature|Locke's three lacking things in the State of Nature]] - known, settled and established law
 - Separation of Powers - Branch I, the legislative power
 - Congress intended to be the 'cornerstone' of the constitutional republic
	 - Closest to the people, makes law, most powerful
	 - Length of Article I itself, very purposeful in construction, intended to make passing law difficult
- Purpose of Government from the [[The Declaration of Independence and Locke|Declaration of Independence]]
