## Rights
---
What are 'rights'
 - Normative argument concerning the relationship between human beings - force
	 - Often within the framework of government - relationship between citizens and their government
- Moral component/foundation
	- What is 'just'?... What is 'justice'?... When may force or the threat of it be used

[[The Declaration of Independence and Locke#Law of Nature|Natural Rights]], foundation of the Constitution and therefore American politics and government
 - It is just to leave one to their own life, liberty and pursuit of happiness; force or threat of it only justified based on infringement of [[The Declaration of Independence and Locke#Law of Nature|Natural Rights]] or the threat of it - to secure [[The Declaration of Independence and Locke#Law of Nature|Natural Rights]] of individuals

Government-given rights, the antithesis of natural rights
 - It is just for the government (or the majority) to determine rights, natural rights not a part; force or threat of it justified by government (or the majority) - for what ever is decided by those who wield power

Purpose of government: secure and protect the individuals' [[The Declaration of Independence and Locke#Law of Nature|Natural Rights]] versus whatever the government (or the majority) deems it to be

## Voting
---
Election Day - local, state, and federal elections; ability to vote for representatives

Representation: what are our representatives representing?
 - Descriptive/demographic? - Principles?
 - Different constituencies - districts, states, etc. - House, Senate, president, judges
 - What really matters? - Principles

Free and fair elections, rule of law
 - Voting rules/procedures determined by state legislatures
 - Why does the Constitution require states to determine voting/election laws?

### Lead up to Election Day
---
Primaries/caucuses (most party-affiliated)
 - Precinct-level
	 - Very local, with neighbors
	 - 'Votes' for candidates to endorse
	 - Proposals for party platforms and/or party rules (state and national party)
	 - Selection of delegates for county/House districts
- Primaries tend to be more democratic (voting who should be endorsed)
- Caucuses tend to be more straw-polling (voting is not binding)

County/House district - delegates from precincts (Typically in February)
 - Endorse county and House district candidates
 - Proposals for party platforms and/or party rules (state and national party)
 - Selection of delegates for state conventions

State conventions - delegates from county/House districts (Typically in May)
 - Endorse state candidates (Senators, any state representatives)_
 - Proposals for party platforms and/or rules (state and national party)
 - Select delegates for national conventions, choose Electoral College delegates

National Conventions (Typically in July)
 - Delegates from state conventions - number proportional to number of party membership in the states
 - Endorse national candidates, namely president and vice president
 - Proposals for party platforms and/or rules (national only)
 - Lots of media coverage, big speeches, etc.

Election Day - first Tuesday after the first Monday in November (so 2nd - 8th), even years
 - Midterm Elections (Only entire house plus 1/3 of senators as per [[Article I]])
 - Presidential Elections (Every 4 years as per [[Article II]])

Usually a plurality-vote, candidate with the most votes wins
 - Some states have run-off rules for less than 50%, or small margins of victory
 - House - citizens of the specific district
 - Senate - citizens of the specific state (remember [[Amendment XVII]] that state legislatures used to vote for senators. Now it is the people)
 - President and vice president - Electoral College delegates

### Voter Turnout
---
Voter Turnout historically averages around 60% for presidential years, less for Midterms
 - % of eligible voters who actually vote
 - Highest turnout states get upper 70%
 - What does this tell us about American politics and government?
	 - Very few people engage in precinct-level politics and the election process, just showing up to vote on Election Day, and not everybody does even that
		 - Two-party system, but who is 'the party'
		 - How many voters are informed
	- Self-governing people?

## Gained Office, Now What?
---
Process of governing, politics, making/enforcing/applying law
 - Striving to omplement policy preferences
 - Whose policy preferences, and how do elected officials receive?
	 - Party platforms, party leadership - the people
	 - Citizen communication - calls, letters, emails, townhalls, local speeches, events, etc.
	 - Interest Groups
		 - "any formal association of individuals or organizations that attempt to influence government decision-making and/or the making of public policy"
		 - [[Development of the Constitution#Federalist 10 and Federalist 51|Federalist 10]]

### Interest Groups
---
What are they?
- Voluntary
- Like-minded people 
- Like factions as Madison defined them in [[Development of the Constitution#Federalist 10 and Federalist 51|Federalist 10]]

How do they come to be formed?

What do they do?
 - influence/lobby - both inside and outside government
 - Monitor government
 - Provide Information - to government officials, other groups, the people
 - Conduit to political participations
	 - Efficacy

Examples:
 - Grassroots organizations - groups of citizens coming together under common cause
 - Membership organization - unions, groups like NRA, etc.
 - Companies/corporations - 3M, Target, American Beverage Association (Coke and Pepsi)
 - Governments - Department of Educations, state and local governments
 - Universities and think tanks - Council on Foreign Relations, Center for American Progress, Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, etc.
 - An ever-increasing number and types of interest groups, increasingly professionalized lobbying efforts, why?
	 - Big, active government

## Media
---
What is 'media'? - communication formats
 - Print ([[Development of the Constitution#Federalist 10 and Federalist 51|Federalists v. Antifederalists]]), radio (1920s), network television (1950s), cable television (1980s), internet, blogs and social media (2000s)
 - Mass media - collection of all forms of media communicating information to the general public

What role do they play in our government?
 - 'fourth estate' - constitutional protection - [[Amendment I]]
 - Keep the people informed, platform for discourse, hold government accountable
 - 'sunshine laws' - Freedom of Information Act (1966)

Free speech, importance to self-government

Highlights importance of public discourse

Does our media today help or hurt our self-government? - why?

We the People are the ultimate power behind our media
 - They function based on what we ask/require of them
 - 'soft news' - news presented in an entertaining style
 - 'informational model' - impartiality, accuracy, promotes transparency in government and politics
 - Which should we, as a self-governing people, demand?

### Power of the Media
---
Agenda setting - which issues/topics/concerns get media attention?
 - who chooses what is 'news'?

Framing - creating context for the 'news'
 - Additional analysis/thoughts beyond the facts

Priming - media coverage can predispose a particular perspective
 - Coverage itself may sway people

Images and word choice matter greatly

Power - the way our 'news'/information is presented to us has a huge impact on what we think about, how we think about it, and what action we take concerning

## Self-Governing People
---
We are intended to be a self-governing people, our [[Development of the Constitution#Democracy vs. republic|constitutional republic]] is set up as such (Constitution), based on the principles of the [[The Declaration of Independence and Locke|Declaration of Independence]]
 - They are what unite us as one people, a nation
 - They are to guide our decision-making in governing ourselves

We the People have innumerable avenues/opportunities to influence and control our government, whether we do so or not
 - Ultimately it is our government, and we can make of it what we will (constraints?)
 - How we define the purpose of government, how we view our relationship to our government, how we view our relationship to our neighbors, how we understand the Declaration's principles, how we approach and interpret the Constitution, and what we do about all these things, defines what we think 'life' is and who we are as a people
 - Among the biggest and most important questions, impacting every single other facet of life
 - Most worthy of our consideration, we have to think about these things, we have to discuss these things, national discourse concerning - what are we justified in forcing others to do or not do
