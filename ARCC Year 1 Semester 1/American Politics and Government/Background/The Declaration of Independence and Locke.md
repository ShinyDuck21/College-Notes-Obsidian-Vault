The Constitution is the Foundation of American politics and government

Constitution built upon the principles of the declaration
 - Making concrete the abstract

Locke quite helpful in understanding the Declaration's principles
 - Concept of natural rights, the purpose of government, etc.

How did it come to be?
 - Subject to British rule (Monarchy), yet in 1789 they became the United States of America, an Independent nation as a constitutional republic
 - Declaration = Public Justification
	 - Didn't just cut ties, they tried to justify
- The foundational Principles upon which the government would be built, is built

#### The Great Statement of Principle
---
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness - That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed"
 - This is the most important statement in American government
 - What does this mean?
	 - "We" - Who
		 - American Colonists
		 - Declaration made by representatives from colonies
		 - All American who subscribe to the government
	- "truths to be self-evident" - What Truths? Self-evident?
		- Stated in the quote
		- Those are true just as 2+2=4 or the sun will always rise in the east
		- Universal Statement
			- Always true
			- Cannot Change
	- "all men are created equal" = Meaning? Equal how?
		- Men = Mankind
		- **Everyone** holds those unalienable rights
		- Created equal
	- "endowed by their Creator" - Why is this here?
		- Speaks to this creator, higher power, or god
		- Something created humans
		- Therefore no one else has more rights than another
		- Human beings are created by something else
	- "Certain unalienable rights" - 
		- There are **Certain** rights
		- That cannot be taken away
		- What are rights
			- "among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of Happiness" - Meaning what, Specifically? Who Decides?
				- No unalienable right to happiness. Unalienable right to **pursue** happiness
	- "Secure these rights" - Are they not secure then?
		- "Governments are instituted among men" So, where does the government come from then? And why?
			- Governments come from with in
			- When you have this equality no one can force another to be a part of a government
			- Among you not over you
		- Governments are created to secure rights
		- "deriving their powers from the consent of the governed" - Whose powers? Just? Consent?
			- Powers of the government
			- Powers that are just are the ones secured from the government
			- Governments are not forced upon anyone


"That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government"
 - The ends = the purpose
 - The people have a right to alter a government or to abolish it if it is destructive
 - Making argument why justified

"But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future safety"
 - They experiences lots of abuses from Britain so it is their right to break away from Britain

"Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government"
 - Wasn't a whim and fancy
 - Well thought out
 - It is our right

"The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these States. To prove this let Facts be submitted to a candid world"
 - All the same complaints come up in the bill of rights and the constitution

#### Principles of the Declaration (Locke: 1634-1702)
---
These principles did not just come out of nowhere, the Founders built on the work of others
 - They spent enormous amounts of time thinking and discussing
 - Plato and Aristotle (4th century BC) largely credited with starting "Western" political thought
 - Magna Carta (1215) - government given rights
	 - "I acknowledge that as king there are rights I cannot take away from you barons"
- English Bill of Rights (1689) - Government Given rights
	- Similar to American Bill of Rights
	- Not Natural Rights
- Age of Enlightenment
	- Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, Smith, Montesquieu, Locke
		- Montesquieu - "The Spirit of Laws" 1748 - Separation of Powers
		- Locke - "Second Treatise of Government" 1689 - Natural rights, purpose of government
			- The most influential document in our government
			- "Father of Liberalism" - Classical Liberalism ([[American Politics and Government/Week 2|Week 2]]) - Individual Rights etc.

#### State of Nature
---
"to understand political power right, and derive it from it from its original, we must consider, what state all men are naturally in, and that is, a state of perfect freedom to order their actions and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit within the bounds of the law of nature, without asking leave, or depending upon the will of any other man"
 - "A state also of equality where in all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one having more than another"
 - Nobody can tell you you have to do something
 - Everyone is completely free
 - What problems may arise from such a situation?
	 - Force

#### Law of Nature
---
"The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions"
 - you cannot break or intrude on another
 - No body can harm another

"Every one, as he is bound to preserve himself, and not to quit his station willfully, so by the like reason when his own preservation comes not in competition, ought he, as much as he can, to preserve the rest of mankind and may not, unless it be to do justice on an offender, take away, or impair the life, or what tends to the preservation of the life, the liberty, health, limb, or goods of another"
 - Obligation to help rest of humanity to help survive
 - Help others
	 - Unless to do justice on an offender (broken law of nature) then justified to take away life etc.

How does this law of Nature impact concept of Government? Does it establish some sort of restritctions? Promote particular actions? - What if one does not adhere to the Law of Nature, what then?
 - Government or person cannot harm somebody can't harm someone in their life, health, liberty or possessions
 - Sets up framework of government
 - Government is there to punish those who do not follow the law of nature.

#### State of War
---
"Men living together according to reason, without a common superior on earth, with authority to judge between them, is properly the state of nature. But force, or a declared design of force, upon the person of another, where there is no common superior on earth to appeal to for relief, is the state of war"
 - no one superior to another
 - What does this state mean for relations betwixt people? Is this an attractive state?
	 - No because people become worried about their possessions and belongings
	 - As soon as force becomes involved it is unattractive

"To avoid this state of war (wherein there is no appeal but to heaven, and wherein every the least difference is apt to end, where there is not authority to decide between the contenders) is one great reason of men's putting themselves into society, and quitting the state of nature: for where there is an authority, a power on earth, from which relief can be had by appeal, there the continuance of the state of war is excluded, and the controversy is decided by that power"
 - What does this tell us about the purpose of government? Implications?
	 - Argument going to end in the ultimate force of killing another. Not until heaven is when we can determine who was right and wrong
	 - Sooner to determine who was right and wrong
	 - Not forced into society and consent into society
	 - Power on earth through society
	 - Purpose of government also is to avoid the state of war
		 - Government doing other things is right


#### Property
---
"every man has a property in his own person. This no body has any right to but himself. The labour of his body and the work of his hands, we may say are properly his"
 - No body has any right to anything that is yours except you
 - Things you do with your body and your hands it yours
 - Your ideas are yours
 - Government can't take your property without your consent

#### The Formulation of Government
---
"Men being, as has been said, by nature, all free, equal, and independent, no one can be put out of this estate (the State of Nature), and subjected to the political power of another, without his own consent. The only way whereby any one divests himself of his natural liberty, and puts on the bonds of civil society, is by agreeing with other men to join and unite into a community for the comfortable, safe, and peaceable living one amongst another, in a secure enjoyment of their properties, and a greater security against any, that are not of it."
 - How is lawful government formed?
	 - Deriving powers from consent of the governed

"And thus every man, by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself under an obligation, to every one of that society, to submit to the determination of the majority"
 - Founding fathers and locke disagree here
 - Why?
	 - Locke argues:
		 - Because everyone is equal and consented to a civil society what most individuals want to do is what we do
	- Founding Fathers argues:
		- Majority is too likely to introduce force
 - Equality?
	 - Majority always beats minority
	 - **You** are the smallest of minorities
 - Are there limits to this? To what the majority may do?
	 - No

#### The Purpose of Government
---
"If man in the state of nature be so free...if he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions, equal to the greatest and subject to no body, why will he part with his freedom? Why will he give up this empire, and subject himself to the dominion and control of any other power?"

"To which it is obvious to answer, that though in the state of nature he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of it is very uncertain, and constantly exposed to the invasion of others: for all beings kings as much as he, every man his equal, and the greater part no strict observers of equity and justice, the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition which however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property"
 - You have this right of great freedom. Why would you give it up?
	 - Mutual Preservation of your life and estates which he calls property

"The great and chief end, therefore, of men's uniting into common-wealths, and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property. To which in the state of nature there are many things wanting"

Possessions are insecure as someone is too willing to take your stuff

3 big weaknesses in the State of Nature:
1. "an established, settled known law received and allowed by common consent to be the standard of right and wrong"
	- Legislative Power
	- How do you know it is wrong to just take something from someone?
	- Makes the law
2. "a known and indifferent judge, with authority to determine all differences according to the established law"
	 - Judicial Power
	 - If we have a law we can point to it. We need an indifferent and impartial judge to say "
	   Party A you're wrong and Party B you're good"
	 - Interprets the law
3. "power to back and support the sentence when right, and to give it due execution"
	 - Executive Power
	 - Somebody can perform an actual punishment
	 - Executes the Law

#### Restraints on government
---
"But though men, when they enter into society, give up the equality, liberty, and executive power they had in the state of nature, into the hands of society, to be so far disposed of by the legislative, as the good of society shall require; yet it being only with an intention in every one the better to preserve himself, hit life and property; (for no ration creature can be supposed to change his condition with an intention to be worse) the power of the society, or legislative constituted by them, can never be supposed to extend farther, than the common good; but is obliged to secure everyone's property, by providing against those three defects above mentioned, that made the state of nature so unsafe and uneasy."
 - What is the restraint here?
	 - Governmental Action must be geared to the common good.
	- Whether or not the majority wants it

#### Unjust and Illegitimate Government
---
"Tyranny is the exercise of power beyond right, which no body can have a right to" or "Commands and actions...not directed to the preservations of the properties of (the) people."
 - If government exercises power beyond the preservation of properties and the people is unjust and illegitimate

#### Revolution
---
"But if either these illlegal acts have extended to the majority of the people or if the mischief and oppression has lighted only on some few, but in such cases, as the precedent, and consequences seem to threaten all; and they are persuaded in their consciences, that their laws, and with them their estates, liberties, and lives are in danger, and perhaps their religion too; how they will be hindered from resisting illegal force, used against them, I cannot tell"

"if a long train of actions shew the councils all tending that way"

"In these and the like cases, when the government is dissolved, the people are at liberty to provide for themselves, by erecting a new legislative, differing from the other, by the change of persons, or form, or both, as they shall find it most for their safety and good"
