 - Senators (Senate) - Aids, Clerks, etc.
 - President and Vice-President - Chief of Staff, Aids, Clerks, etc.
	 - Plethora of appointed officials, Cabinet members
	 - Massive numbers of bureaucrats, just hired under cabinet members
	 - All have aides, clerks, etc.
- Judges - Clerks
- Many, many members of the federal government - about three million, not counting active-duty military

### How do they get there?
---
 - Some voted in directly by the people - elections
	 - Representatives - always have been
	 - Senators - only since [[Amendment XVII]], used to be state legislatures
- Two voted in indirectly by the people
	- Electoral College - president and vice-president
- More indirectly by the people - the appointment process - president and senate
	- Judges, ambassadors, Cabinet members, secretaries, agency heads (about 1,300)

## Bureaucracy
---
What is it?
 - A group of unelected government employees who 'administer' programs and policies
 - Bureaucrats/civil servants
 - Vast majority of government employees are bureaucrats
	 - Divided into 'essential' and 'non-essential'

Bureaucracy and the Constitution
 - Not speciffically mentioned, but alluded to
 - [[Article I# Section 8|Art. I, Sec. 8]] - enumerated powers, who will actually do these things?
 - [[Article II#Section 2|Art. II, Sec. 2]] - appointments and [[Article II#Section 3]] "faithfully executed", who will actually do these things?
Limited Government necessitated limited Bureaucracy
 - Washington Administration found these things essential to the execution of the constitution
	 - Departments of State (Deals with Relations with other nations)
	 - Treasury (Deals with money and coining money)
	 - Department of War (deals with military)
- deals back to Necessary and proper Clause
- Also, post office under the core constitution
- Merit-based system

### Change in the Bureaucracy
---
 - Progressive Era (late 1800s to early 1900s) and President Wilson grew and 'professionalized' the bureaucracy
	 - Rise of the administrative state, 'experts'
- New Deal (1930s through 1940s), vast expansion of federal government contained many. many new programs ('rights')
	- All these programs needed 'experts' to implement and run, to administer them
	- Bureaucracy necessarily expanded with government's expansion in size and power
- Great Society (1960s) again a time of great expansion, bureaucracy followed (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid)
- Some push back in the 1980s, some recent years, but still largely ever-expanding

### Types of Bureaucracies
---
Cabinet Departments
 - 15 currently 
	 1. Department of State
	 2. Department of Treasury
	 3. Department of War (Used to be Department of Defense)
	 4. Department of Agriculture
	 5. Department of Transportation

 - Led by secretaries, directly accountable to the president (supposed to be)
 - Broad 'jurisdiction'
 - Tiered, hierarchical structure beneath, most are massive departments

Regulatory agencies
 - CIA, NASA, EPA, FDA, FCC, CDC, etc.
 - Heads appointed and report directly to the president, more focused than cabinets

Odd ones: Federal Reserve, USPS, Amtrack, etc.

### Ramifications
---
 - Professional Bureaucrats
	 - May be too independent of elected members
	 - May not respond to political changes
	 - Focus on personal preferences of those of their department/agency instead of elected officials
- Bureaucratic interests often self-interested, 'experts'
	- Limited resources fought over by different bureaucrats, working against each other instead of with
	- Maximize budgets every year, tendency to grow beyond what is necessary, creating much waste
- Lack of competition - breeds inefficiency and waste, frustration - e.g., passports
- Huge impacts on American politics and Government
- Presidents don't have Control of the Bureaucracy
