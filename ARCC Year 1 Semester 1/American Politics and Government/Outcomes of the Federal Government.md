## Foreign Policy
---
Managing relations with the other nations/people of the world
 - Isolationism
 - Internationalism

No central authority - all nations sovereign
 - United Nations (UN)
	 - General Assembly
	 - Security Council
- North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)

## Executive Leads
---
Constitution provides for the executive to lead the way in foreign policy
 - Head of our government
 - Ambassadors
 - Commander-in-chief
 - Treaties/agreements

Still Checks and Balances here though
 - Congress (Senate) approves appointments
 - Congress (Senate) ratifies treaties with 2/3 vote
 - Congress declares war (last time was World War Two)
 - Congress appropriates funds

## Domestic Policy
---
Internal, longer-term policy preferences of government officials, not just single laws

Progressives (liberals) v. Conservatives
 - Progressives believe government's purpose and principles should 'progress' along with society
	 - Ends - generally concerned with 'equality' in outcomes, economic - government-given rights
	 - Big, robust, heavily involved government
- Conservatives believe government's purpose and principles should stay the same
	- Means - generally concerned with 'equality' in means - natural rights
	- Small limited, minimally involved government

## Economic Theory
---
Laissez-faire economics - conservatives
 - Economic growth & development best achieved with no 'interference' from government
 - Hands-off, free market, capitalism
 - Government sets the rules and enforces, that is it - only justifiable economic action by government

Keynesian economics - progressives
 - Economic growth & development best achieved with targeted government 'interference'
 - Active government, planning, regulations
 - Government does all sorts of things in the economy - anything may be justified

## Government Spending
---
"A country spends, raises, and regulates money in accordance with its values."

Fiscal Year 2021 - latest 'accurate' data
 - Expenditures = $6,800,000,000,000 ($6.8 Trillion)
 - Revenue = $4.0 Trillion
 - Deficit - $2.8 Trillion
 - GDP = $22.3 Trillion (federal government spending 30.5% of GDP)

How much is a trillion dollars?
 - Million = stack of $100 bills 43 inches high
	 - billion = 3,600 feet high
	 - Trillion = 631 miles high, so roughly 4,300 miles in 2021
	 - Could spend $1 Million/Day for 3,000 years
	 - about 2 months for the federal government in 2021

Impossible to track all the federal dollars

You can't wrap your mind around this much money

### Budgeting
---
New Deal programs brought idea of 'mandatory' and 'discretionary' spending
 - 'mandatory' entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Unemployment Insurance, SNAP and federal employee retirement packages
	 - Expenditures set up by previous legislation, formulas
	 - About 70% ($4.8 Trillion) of federal budget in 2021
- 'discretionary' spending is authorized every year
	- About 25% ($1.6 Trillion) of federal budget in 2021
	- 1/2 military, other 1/3 employee salaries and building maintenance
- Also now have interest on national debt - about 5% ($352 Billion) in 2021

Balancing the budget, cut spending, raise 'revenue' (increase taxes)

### Taxes
---
Government revenue raised through the taxation
 - but who to tax and how much?
 - Progressive income taxes - 2018 (lag even further beyond finalized budget numbers)
	 - Top 1% earned 20.9% of income, paid 10.1%
	 - Top 10% earned 47.7%, paid 71.4%
	 - Bottom 90% earned 52.3%, paid 28.6%
	 - Top 50% earned 88.4%, paid 97.1%
	 - Bottom 50% earned 11.6%, paid 2.9%
- Income taxes make up over 1/2 of all taxes/revenue
	- Payroll taxes make up 1/3
	- Corporate income tax about 9%
	- Roughly 8% from excise taxes tariffs, estate taxes, misc. taxes and fees

[[Amendment XVI]] Severed connection between 'say and pay'
 - Creating this tax system
 - Allowing for majority to tax minority

## Legislative Today (Written November, 2025)
---
House = 220 Republicans, 213 Democrats, 3 vacant (a death, two resignations)

Senate = 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, 2 Independents (caucus with Democrats)

Highly Partisan in recent times

Bills must be identical, generally means Senate gets its way, Senate harder to pass legislation, by design
 - Filibuster - meaning 60 votes to get things done, not in [[Article I|Constitution, Art. I]] grants power to determine own rules
	 - Filibuster used to mean that a senator has to talk until there are 60 votes to shut them up
	 - Now Filibuster just makes a bill require 60 votes
 - Senate has practiced filibuster since 1806

Spends vast quantities of money

Legislative way more powerful than envisioned/intended by the 'core' Constitution

## Executive Today (Written November, 2025)
---
President Trump and Vice President Vance
 - Both Republicans

Lead on foreign policy - 'friends' and 'enemies' often change with administrations

Executive Orders - frequently overturn previous administration's, increasingly treated as law

Head of ever-increasing in size and power [[Administrative State and Bureaucracy|bureaucracy/administrative state]], but not really in control
 - Great power and authority given to executive by Congress - 'emergency powers'

'Bully pulpit' - 'mandate from the people' - presidents frequently lead on policy, pushing Congress in a given direction

Executive way more powerful than envisioned/intended by the 'core' constitution

## Judicial Today (Written November, 2025)
---
Supreme Court
 - Chief Justice Roberts (Appointed by President George W. Bush)
 - Justice Thomas (Appointed by President George H. W. Bush)
 - Justice Alito (Appointed by President George W. Bush)
 - Justice Sotomayor (Appointed by President Barrack Obama)
 - Justice Kagan (Appointed by President Barrack Obama)
 - Justice Gorsuch (Appointed by President Donald Trump)
 - Justice Kavanaugh (Appointed by President Donald Trump)
 - Justice Coney Barret (Appointed by President Donald Trump)
 - Justice Jackson (Appointed by President Joe Biden)
Referred to as a 6-3 (conservative-progressive/liberal)

881 other [[Article III|Art. III]] judges, about 475 appointed by Democratic presidents and 357 by Republican (about 20 vacant)

Highly partisan in recent times

Federal courts increasingly push Congress for specific legislation - 'legislating from the bench'

Courts increasingly use injunctions to stymie both legislative and executive
 - [[Article III#Judicial review|Judicial Review]] - one federal judge can over turn law - 'venue shopping'

Judiciary way more powerful than envisioned/intended by the 'core' constitution

## Highly Partisan
---
Common thread of all three branches becoming highly partisan, why?
 - Federal government much more involved in the everyday life of Americans, great growth in size and power
 - Two basic ways of viewing government and it's purpose, very different
	 - Natural Rights v. Government-Given Rights
	 - Limited government (constraining use of force) v. unlimited government (no constraints on use of force)
	 - Constitutional Republic v. Democracy
- Of course, not so black and white, but generally speaking - no compromise between these positions
- Rights and the purpose of government at the heart of the situation
- Republicans and Democrats - Conservatives and Progressives - conserve the principles of the Declaration and Constitution or 'progress' them (change them) - these are antithetical to one another = partisanship
