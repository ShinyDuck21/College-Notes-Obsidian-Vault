States aggrieved by consistent expansion of federal power, loss of state power 
 - [[Amendment XI#Judicial Review - *Marbury v. Madison* (1803)|Marbury (1803)]], [[Implied Powers#*McCulloch v. Maryland* (1819)|McCulloch (1819)]], [[Article I#Section VIII|Gibbons (1824)]], etc.

Tariff Acts during Jackson really pushed the issue, states argued they can 'veto' bills they find unconstitutional
 - Big problem as the states lose power
 - If states say we can veto bills we find unconstitutional
	 - Bigger argument than [[Article III#Judiciary Act of 1789|Judiciary Act of 1789]] since states made constitution

Some Southern states threatened to leave the union, federal government responded by passing legislation authorizing force to make states comply to Tariff Acts
 - Simply federal government put tariffs to the gun
 - Lowering tariffs quieted secession

During Articles of Confederation state courts would rule in state favor. Federal Courts would rule in federal favor
 - Biased to state/federal government

States made the argument that they could nullify laws just like judicial branch.
 - More constitutionally sound argument because states made constitution

## *Dred Scott V. Sanford* (1857)
---
 - Louisiana Purchase, Missouri Compromise, slavery
 - Slave brought to free territories, but returned to Missouri sued for freedom upon return
 - Court ruled could not sue as not a citizen but rather property
 - Furthermore, Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional (first exercise of judicial review since [[Amendment XI#Judicial Review - *Marbury v. Madison* (1803)|Marbury]] in 1803)
 - Taney, and Court, thought this would resolve slavery issue, but opposite effect
 - Lincoln - 1860, secession, [[Civil War]], 1863 made it much more about slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation
