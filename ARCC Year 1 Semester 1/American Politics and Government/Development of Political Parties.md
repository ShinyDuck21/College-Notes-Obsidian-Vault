Almost immediately in thinking 1792-1796

Federalist Party v. Democratic-republican Party (Antifederalist) 1792-1824
 - Federalist - more active federal government
	 - Especially on economy
	 - 'loose' readings of the constitution
	 - Hamilton = Federalist and loose
- Democratic-Republican - more limited federal government, state governments key
	- 'tight' readings of the constitution
	- Jefferson = Democratic-Republican and tight
	- Madison "Father of Constitution" = Democratic Republican also
- Courts played/play huge role in federalism

Whig Party v. Democratic Party 1824-1854
 - fracturing of Democratic-Republican Party after war of 1812
 - Largely still Federalist v. Antifederalist divide
	 - Active and robust federal government v. limited federal government
	 - Economy and national bank
- Whigs led by Henry Clay
- Democrats led by Andrew Jackson
- Cleavage - democracy became a key issue for Democratic Party though - expanded voting 'rights' away from property requirements, push to elect judges, get the majority more involved in governing

Slavery still big Issue ignored by both parties
