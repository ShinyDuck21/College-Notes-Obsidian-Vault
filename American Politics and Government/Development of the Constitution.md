### Federalist 10 and Federalist 51
---
10 - What is it about?
 - Factions
 - Democracy versus a republic
 - "Complaints are everywhere heard... that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflict of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority"
	 - The problem with democracy?
		 - The majority tends to tyrannize the minority.
	- Cure for factions:
		- Removing causes
			- Destroying liberty
			- Same opinions and passions
			- "The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate...the protection of these faculties is the first object of government"
			- "The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man"
				- "No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause because his interest would certainly bias his judgement, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity"
	- "The infrence to which we are brought is, that the causes of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects"
		- What if minority faction? - republican principle
		- WHat is majority faction?
			- "To secure public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and form of popular government, is then the great object to which out inquiries are directed"
- "Among the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed union, non deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction"
	- "By faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community"

51 - What is it About?
 - Structure of government
	 - Separation of powers
	 - checks and balances

## Democracy vs. republic
---
"Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their death."
 - Departure from Locke

"Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions"
 - Equality in the means or in the ends

"The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended"
 - How do these help with controlling effects of faction
 - Representation
	 - "refine and enlarge the public views" & "more difficult for unworthy candidates"
- Size
	- More parties and interests involved, harder to capture a majority
