## Defines other rights
 - Didn't cover all [[The Declaration of Independence and Locke#Law of Nature|Natural Rights]] in earlier amendments so this defines this
 - Cannot take away other rights
	 - Example: Right to Pursue Education or Right to Pursue a Job
	 - But not Right **TO** Education or Right **TO** a Job
