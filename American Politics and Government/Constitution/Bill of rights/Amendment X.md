## States Rights
 - All power not allocated to the federal government is allocated to the states
 - [[Article IV]] puts limits on state governments
 - Only reason we gave federal government that power is because we thought it would secure our rights better
	 - 10th amendment reinforces this
- If it is not allocated by constitution, federal government does not have it.
