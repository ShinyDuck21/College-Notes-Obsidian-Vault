 - Federalists were very confident that structure of government would restrain government to its purpose - securing natural rights
 - To get enough Antifederalist support for unanimous ratification, was agreed to add a Bill of Rights immediately
 - 1st Congress (2/3 both chambers) did so September 25, 1789, State Legislatures (3/4) ratified December 15, 1791
	 - 12 were proposed by Congress, 10 ratified (Congressional Apportionment formula and election between pay)
		 - Congressional Apportionment formula amendment's goal was to set a number of representatives per population (i.e. one representative per 50,000 people)
		 - Election Between Pay amendment's goal was to stipulate that members of congress could not give themselves a pay raise that would take effect before the next election of representatives, thereby ensuring voter accountability. This amendment would be instead ratified more than two centuries later in 1992 as the 27th Amendment
- Purpose was to solidify natural rights, further explicit constraints on governmental power
- No end in controversy to these amendments - need to keep the purpose of government in mind though
- Civil liberties - guarantees of freedoms, civil rights - equal treatment before government\
- They knew there would never be a perfect government - but this would be the best attempt at being one
- Amendments 11-27 come up as the government and time unfolds

Congressional Statement: "The Conventions of a number of States, having at the time of their adopting the Constitution, ==expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction of abuse of its powers, that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added==: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government, will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution."
 - Congress is saying that it is fulfilling their end of the deal
 - 2/3 of House and Senate agreed to propose and send to state legislatures for ratification, pursuant to [[Article V|Article V's Amending Process]]
