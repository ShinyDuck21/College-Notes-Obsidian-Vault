 
 ## 1.1 Four Communication Scenarios
---
The scenarios show 4 different methods of communication though not defined

The end of the sub chapter talks about how the soft skill of communication is needed in todays work environment
 - It specifically mentions that 19 surveys that rank skills employers want all have communication in some form in the top 3 listing

## 1.2 Defining Communication
---
SMCR Model (See [[Chapter 1 Graphic.canvas|Chapter 1 Graphic]])
 - Source -> Message -> Channel -> Receiver -> Feedback

The Birthday Present Model
1. Sender figures out how to encode the message (ex. other driver flashing lights)
2. Receiver has to decode message (ex. turn on headlights)

**Communication is a process in which one person with a construct in their mind uses symbols such as language to try to get another person to formulate the same construct in their mind.**

Communication is very hard to define what is and what is not communication and can be simplified into these 3 models: SMCR model ([[Chapter 1 Graphic.canvas|Chapter 1 Graphic]]), Birthday Present Model, and the Lego Model

## 1.3 Perception and Metaperception
---

[Self-Monitoring Scale](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/SMS/)
 - Measures degree to which people are concerned about other people's reactions to them
 - High Self-Monitor = Sensitive to other people's reactions
 - Low Self-Monitor = aren't concerned with what others think
 - Jones and Pittman took this a step further by asking "What kind of impression do people want to create?" and hypothesized 5 categories
	 1. **ingratiation**: I want you to like me
	 2. **intimidation**: I want you to be scared of me
	 3. **self-promotion:** I want you to be impressed by my intelligence or skills
	 4. **exemplification:** I want you to be impressed by my moral purity
	 5. **supplication:** I want you to feel sorry for me\

Metaperception
 - Perception = "how I see you"
 - Metaperception = "How I think you see me"
 - How has social media affected this?
	 - Caused obsession over metaperception
	 - Harm comes in with the constant comparison effect

Communication can occur without words or direct interaction

Can come from non-verbal cues

Communication through speech is a remarkable human ability
